# vocab_check

Vocab checker is a sublime text 3 plugin which works like a reverse spell checker. A spell checker finds combinations of letters which are not found in a dictionary; vocab checker finds words which are in a given list of words which the author wishes to avoid using.

Meant to help writers catch words which make their writing less clear. eg. George Orwell advised to avoid words of non-English origin, Strunk and White offer a list of words and phrases to avoid, eliminating adjectives and adverbs.
